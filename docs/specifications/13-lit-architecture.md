# DOCUMENT 13 — Lit Architecture

Do not force Lit across the application. React should own page composition, routing, data loading, form orchestration, and role-specific workflows. Lit provides value where the product needs framework-neutral, stateful widgets or future embedding in partner portals.

Recommended Lit components are `vk-location-picker`, `vk-nearby-results`, `vk-animal-summary`, `vk-feed-calculator`, `vk-symptom-stepper`, `vk-chat-composer`, `vk-rating-input`, and `vk-map-cluster`. Keep components presentational and event-driven: properties for inputs, custom events for changes, and slots for labels/help. Do not allow a web component to bypass React authorization or submit directly without the API client contract.

Share CSS custom properties and design tokens. Expose accessible labels, keyboard behavior, form-associated custom elements where appropriate, and SSR-safe hydration boundaries. Begin with React-native components; promote a widget to Lit only when it has a stable contract, needs framework interoperability, or is embedded outside Next.js.
